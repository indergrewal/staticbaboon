# Static Baboon

This repository contains a simple multi-page website for Static Baboon. It includes:

- **Home** (`index.html`) – introduction and call to action.
- **Services** (`services.html`) – overview of available services.
- **About** (`about.html`) – information about Sukh and the company.
- **Contact / Booking** (`contact.html`) – a basic booking form and contact details.

Styles are defined in `style.css`, and a tiny script in `script.js` handles booking form submission.
